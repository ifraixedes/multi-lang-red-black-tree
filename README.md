Multi-languages red-black tree
==============================

In this repository I'm doing a basic implementation of a [red-black](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree) tree in several languages.
This a personal spare time task that I'm thinking to do through the time because I'm interested in implementing it with several programming languages that I've been hacking around or just only reading documentation to be able to have a comparison between those, do something with those that I haven't doing anything so far.

You can find the reasons about why a red-black tree data structure in this [blog post](http://blog.fraixed.es/2015/03/02/hanging-around-with-red-black-trees-implementations/).
